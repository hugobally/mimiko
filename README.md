# mimiko
mimiko uses graphs to help you map your music and discover new sounds

Using the Spotify recommendation API and Oauth, it allows you to start from a song you like and explore a graph of related songs. In short, it's a visualized playlist ! It is all persisted on the server, and you can explore other users' playlists.

A quick demo:

(I'm not currently working on this project anymore so I took it offline, but I plan to come back to it at some point ᵀᴹ. However you can test it locally by cloning the repo. Don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter any issue)
